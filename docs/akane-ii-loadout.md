# Akane II — Loadout Detail

Companion to [akane-ii-design.md](akane-ii-design.md) (§3.6 Loadout).

> All stats are **starting values for tuning**. Frames are at 60 FPS. Distances are in tiles (one tile is roughly Akane's body width). Item names for the original game's equipment are kept for continuity, but their behavior here is new.

## 1. Katanas

Sword rules shared by all katanas:

- A swing can **deflect bullets** during its active frames (the Rebi has a wider window).
- Sword kills **refill gun ammo** (see §2).
- Sword kills build the combo and Flow like any other kill.

| Katana | Reach | Startup | Active | Recovery | Combo | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Kuro** | 1.5 | 4 f | 5 f | 10 f | 2-hit | Baseline. Moves 0.3 tiles forward on each swing |
| **Rebi** | 1.4 | 6 f | 8 f | 14 f | 1-hit | 160° arc. **Deflect window 8 f** (twice Kuro's). Deflected bullets return at the shooter at double speed |
| **Tadus** | 1.3 (melee) | 5 f | 5 f | 12 f | 1-hit | **Throw:** range 8, flies 0.3 s, then waits. **Recall** returns it along a line in 0.8 s, killing on the way back. Akane has **no melee while it is out.** Auto-recalls after 3 s |
| **Nodachi** | 2.6 | 9 f | 7 f | 18 f | 1-hit | Leaves a **lingering ink arc** for 0.3 s that kills anything passing through it |
| **Twin Tantō** | 0.9 | 3 f | 3 f | 6 f | 3-hit chain | Hits **both sides** at once. Each chain hit moves Akane slightly forward |
| **Echo Blade** | 1.4 | 5 f | 5 f | 11 f | 1-hit | Each swing is repeated in place **1.0 s later** (same angle, same position). One echo at a time, and an echo kills like a swing |
| **Kusarigama** | 1.3 (melee) | 5 f | 5 f | 11 f | 1-hit | **Chain:** range 4. On a standard enemy it pulls the enemy to Akane. On an anchor point (ledge, pole) it pulls Akane there. 3 s cooldown. Does not pull Tanks or bosses |

**Design notes**

- **Kuro** is intentionally good, not just a placeholder: it is the baseline every other katana must have a reason to be picked over.
- **Rebi** is the defensive choice. It pairs with Shooter-heavy waves and the Debt Collector.
- **Tadus** has a real cost (no melee while it's out), and a real reward (a long-range kill that can clear a line of enemies).
- **Nodachi** wants space and Anchor enemies (it punishes slow Tanks and Lancers).
- **Twin Tantō** is the crowd cutter, and weak to Lancers and anything with reach.
- **Echo Blade** is for planners: swing, then dash through the same spot as the echo lands.
- **Kusarigama** doubles as a mobility tool, and brings Archers and Snipers within reach.

## 2. Guns

Gun rules shared by all guns:

- **Sword kills refill ammo,** by the amount in the table.
- **Passive regeneration:** if empty, one round returns every 2.5 s (so Akane is never fully without a gun).
- Guns cannot be used while Akane holds a human shield, except to fire past the shield (a shield does not block Akane's own shots).
- Bullets are blocked by Shieldbearer fronts, except the Magnum.

| Gun | Ammo | Fire rate | Sword-kill refill | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Patron v26** | 6 | 4 / s | +1 | 12 | Accurate and forgiving. Single target |
| **Inquisitor M103** | 9 (3 bursts) | One burst of 3 in 0.25 s, then 0.4 s gap | +1 | 12 | Burst shots fan slightly, covering movement. Good against flyers like drones |
| **Vicious S36** | 30 | 12 / s | +4 | 8 | Sprays with spread. **Recoil pushes Akane back** 0.25 tiles per 3 shots, so firing while facing a wall is a mobility trick |
| **Magnum XT5** | 3 | 1 shot per 1.2 s | +1 | 14 | **Pierces** every enemy in line, including through Shieldbearer shields and Tank armor. Slow |
| **Double Barrel** | 2 | 2 shots, then 0.8 s | +1 | 4 (40° cone) | Kills everything in the cone. **Knocks Akane back** 2 tiles |
| **Gravitational Beam Emitter** | 4 charges | Hold to aim, release to pull | +1 | 7 | **Pulls** enemies in a 2-tile radius to a point over 0.6 s and **holds** them for 1.5 s. Does not kill. Does not pull Tanks or bosses |

**Design notes**

- **Patron** is the baseline. It's deliberately useful in every situation.
- **Inquisitor** is for players who like ranged control.
- **Vicious** rewards skilled recoil use and punishes spraying without a plan.
- **Magnum** is a plan-ahead weapon with a three-shot budget.
- **Double Barrel** is the panic button and a crowd clearer.
- **GBE** is a setup tool and needs a follow-up from the sword, a Dragon Slash or the Echo Blade.

## 3. Gadgets

One slot. All 11 gadgets are strong enough to carry a run. Charges and cooldowns refill during play, and **never** carry between waves in a way that lets them stockpile (cooldowns continue during breathers).

| Gadget | Type | Behavior | Numbers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Cyber Gloves** | Passive | Human shields absorb **4 hits** (not 3). Akane can **dash while holding a shield.** Throws hit harder (the thrown enemy kills two more on impact) | Passive |
| **Marionette Wire** | Active | Wire the held enemy. It becomes a **puppet** that walks ahead as a shield for 5 s (absorbs 3 hits), then detonates or drops on release | 25 s cooldown |
| **Katana Gun** | Passive | Every sword swing also fires a shot along the swing arc | Uses 1 ammo per swing |
| **Magnetic Pulse Emitter** | Active | EMP burst: disables cybernetic enemies for 3 s (Shooters, Cyber Ninjas, Drone Handlers and their drones), strips Tank plating, reveals cloaked enemies | Radius 3.5. Cooldown 25 s |
| **Stabilizer Bracelet** | Passive | **Ink Step window +20%**, a successful Ink Step refunds **both** dash charges (the base rule refunds one), and gun recoil is removed | Passive |
| **Adrenaline Shot** | Triggered | After an **8-kill chain within 6 s,** time slows to 40% for enemies for 3 s. Akane moves at normal speed | Cooldown 20 s |
| **Grapple Anchor** | Active | Grapples a ledge, zipline anchor or standard enemy and pulls Akane there | Range 9. 2 charges. 4 s recharge |
| **Updraft Fan** | Active | Places a fan that launches Akane upward (about 6 tiles). Enemies can also be launched | 2 fans out at once. Each lasts 25 s |
| **Hologram Decoy** | Active | A fake Akane that enemies target for 4 s. Disrupts flanking and token assignment | Cooldown 18 s |
| **Sumi Bomb** | Active | An ink cloud that blocks line of sight for 5 s. Enemies lose tracking | Radius 3.5. 2 charges. 14 s recharge |
| **Lure Beacon** | Active | Thrown device that attracts enemies for 5 s. Does not affect bosses | Cooldown 15 s |

**Design notes**

- **Passive gadgets** (Gloves, Katana Gun, Stabilizer) are always on, so they must be worth a slot without an activation. Their value is steady and skill-rewarding.
- **Active gadgets** give a go-to moment. Cooldowns are short enough to use several times per wave.
- Gadgets never grant invulnerability.

## 4. Boots

| Boots | Dash length | Charges | Recharge | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard** | 3.5 | 2 | 1.5 s | Baseline |
| **Geta Springs** | 3.0 | 2 | 1.5 s | Dash can angle **45° upward** (a leap). Strong on the vertical map |
| **Rail Skates** | 5.0 | 2 | 1.8 s | A longer dash that **slides** for 0.4 s after, with reduced steering |
| **Silent Tabi** | 2.5 | 2 | 1.0 s | Short, quiet and fast to recharge. Enemies that lose sight of Akane **forget her position 2 s sooner** |

**Design notes**

- The dash remains the safe, reliable tool. Boots choose its flavor.
- Silent Tabi is the one oddball. Its effect is subtle, so its real value is faster recharge and the AI interaction.

## 5. Unlock challenges and order

Every item (except starters) is unlocked by an **item-specific mastery challenge** that teaches the skill the item rewards. Challenges are completed in normal arcade runs. Progress counters for "total" challenges accumulate across runs. Unlocks never raise power (see the main doc §8).

**Starting items:** Kuro, Patron v26, Standard boots, Cyber Gloves (it teaches the new shield mechanic). Players may also choose **no gadget.**

| Item | Slot | Tier | Unlock challenge | What it teaches |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Marionette Wire** | Gadget | 3 | Kill **3 enemies with one thrown human shield,** 10 times | Shield mastery |
| **Gravitational Beam Emitter** | Gun | 4 | Defeat **Katsuro and one other boss** in a single run *(capstone)* | Late-game skill |

**Rules**

- Challenges are chosen so that at least one is reachable in the first few runs, and the tier-4 capstone is a long-term goal.
- A challenge counter shows in the loadout screen so players know what to work on.
- No challenge requires an item that has not been unlocked.
- "In total" counters never reset. "In a single run" counters reset on death.

## 6. Synergies and balance checks

### 6.1 Strong, intended combinations

| Combo | Why it works |
|---|---|
| Kusarigama + Grapple Anchor | Two pull tools: fast through the whole map |
| Twin Tantō + Adrenaline Shot | Crowd chains keep Flow III and trigger slow motion |
| Gravitational Beam + Echo Blade or Dragon Slash | Clump, then one kill covers many |
| Magnum + Shieldbearer waves | A single piercing shot cuts through |
| Rebi + Stabilizer Bracelet | Defensive stack. Strong against Shooter waves |
| Cyber Gloves + Tadus | Throw a shield, then a blade |

### 6.2 Combinations to watch for balance

| Combo | Risk | Mitigation to check |
|---|---|---|
| **Rebi + Stabilizer + Sumi Bomb** | Turtling | The combo decay and wave pressure timer make passivity cost score |
| **Double Barrel + Gravitational Beam** | Clump and cone clears every wave | The beam's hold is short and ammo is low |
| **Vicious S36 + Rail Skates** | Mobility spam with sustained fire | Short gun range, ammo burn |
| **Tadus + Cyber Gloves** | A safe ranged kill loop | Tadus leaves Akane unarmed while it is out |
| **Echo Blade + Lure Beacon** | Pre-set trap kills | Beacon's short duration, echo timing |

### 6.3 Balance rules

- **No loadout trivializes a boss.** Each boss has two or more ways to land a hit, and none rely on a single item.
- **Top-run diversity:** in playtests, no single item should appear in more than about 25% of the top runs within its slot **[TBD]**.
- **Ammo economy:** no gun should sustain fire without sword kills for longer than a few seconds.
- **Gadget uptime:** the cooldown of an active gadget should not allow near-permanent coverage.
- **Every item has a weakness** that a specific enemy or boss exploits.
